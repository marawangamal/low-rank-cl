📄 **Paper:** [Revisiting Weight Regularization for Low-Rank Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17559)

In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Moreover, we provide the first systematic investigation of EWC in low-rank CL, showing that it achieves a better stability–plasticity trade-off than other low-rank methods and enables competitive performance across a wide range of trade-off points.

## Overview

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of continual learning methods based on Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA). It includes implementations and extensions of the following approaches:

- InfLoRA
- SD-LoRA
- CL-LoRA
- EWC-LoRA
- [New methods will be updated!]


## Requirements

This project is implemented in PyTorch and tested with the following environment:

- python == 3.8
- torch == 1.11.0
- torchvision == 0.12.1
- timm == 0.6.7


## Install

You can set up the environment using the provided `environment.yaml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

Or install manually:

```bash
conda create -n low-rank-cl python=3.8 pytorch=1.11.0 torchvision=0.12.0 -c pytorch
conda activate low-rank-cl
pip install six ipdb scipy scikit-learn pyyaml tqdm tensorboard timm==0.6.7
```


## Dataset

- CIFAR-100: will be downloaded automatically

- DomainNet: download dataset from https://ai.bu.edu/M3SDA/

- ImageNet-R: download dataset from https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hendrycks/imagenet-r.tar

- ImageNet-A: download dataset from https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hendrycks/imagenet-a.tar

After downloading, place the datasets in your preferred location and create a symbolic link named `data` in the project root directory:

```bash
ln -s /your/dataset/path ./data
```

Alternatively, you can modify the dataset paths directly in the configuration files.


## Training

All experiments were tested on 1-2 Quadro RTX 6000 GPUs (24GB each).

### Quick Start

Run a quick experiment on CIFAR-100 with:

```bash
python main.py --device [GPU_ID] --config configs/[method]/cifar100.json
```

Example:

```bash
python main.py --device 0 --config configs/ewclora/cifar100.json
```

By default, only log files are saved. Model checkpoints are NOT saved to reduce disk usage. To enable checkpoint saving, use the `--save_ckp` flag:

```bash
python main.py --device 0 --config configs/ewclora/cifar100.json --save_ckp
```

For ImageNet-R and ImageNet-A, the train/test split will be processed automatically.
